# PronoesProMod

A mod for the game Hollow Knight that adds a new Dream Realm, the creafted town.

Experience a new location alongside a couple new friends

Master the powers they give you in several interesting arenas

Discover the secrets of the forgotten apprentice of the Soul Master

And enjoy a peaceful time on this new, more relaxing expansion mod for Hollow Knight!

(At least that's the plan, but it's very early in development as of now)

Contents of the mod (planned):
	-A new location called "The Crafted Town"
	-Spell variants to spice up combat
	-Charm upgrades (gotten by talking to Pro with the charm equipped)
	-Lore? Maybe

###The Crafted Town is a mod that's still a work in progress, this is just a beta.
##Please keep the following in mind:
	
	-This is my first Hollow Knight mod, so it will ABSOLUTELLY have bugs and stuff that doesn't work as intended or just breaks in general. You have been warned
	-All the spell swaps are available from the get-go, which will not be the case on the full release (if it ever comes)
	-There's not much to do in the Crafted Town itself, besides get some essence
	-The Town itself is not finished
	-It may not work properly with other mods (looking at rando, the glimmering realm should be ok)
	-The characters in this mod are from my Youtube channel, if you want to see more of them, follow my game development channel "PronoesPro"
	-The reskin is supposed to be a reward for completing the mod, and is unfinished (and will stay that way for a while, sorry)
	-The mod was made for people playing with a controller in mind, so changing spells might not feel as intuitive as you would expect
	-This is just a fun little thing I'm doing, do not expect me to release a full version any time soon, and any criticism you may have might not be heard since this is for myself mainly, you second (I know this sounds mean, but it helps develop the mod faster, thank you for understanding)
	-You are allowed to make mods to change how this mod works, just don't be mean about it... I have feelings after all :C
	-Do not post NSFW art of my characters on SFW places, please (I don't care if you actually do nsfw, just be carefull where you submit it)

	-IMPORTANT: The sawblade attack will probably break Soul Warior, I'm not fixing this for now as it's not important enough. Soul Warior can be cheesed all you want for all I care.
